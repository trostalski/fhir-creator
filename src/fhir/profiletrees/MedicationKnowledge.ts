Typically the rate for an infusion e.g. 100 ml per 1 hour or 100 ml/hr.  May also be expressed as a rate per unit of time e.g. 500 ml per 2 hours.   Other examples: 200 mcg/min or 200 mcg/1 minute; 1 liter/8 hours.  Sometimes, a rate can imply duration when expressed as total volume / duration (e.g.  500mL/2 hours implies a duration of 2 hours).  However, when rate doesn't imply duration (e.g. 250mL/hour), then the timing.repeat.duration is needed to convey the infuse over time period.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"Dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x]","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"Ratio"},{"code":"Range"},{"code":"Quantity","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/SimpleQuantity"]}],"constraint":[{"key":"ele-1","severity":"error","human":"All FHIR elements must have a @value or children","expression":"hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())","xpath":"@value|f:*|h:div","source":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Element"}],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"v2","map":"RXE22, RXE23, RXE-24"},{"identity":"rim","map":".rateQuantity"}]},"dataPath":"root.indicationGuideline.dosingGuideline.dosage.dosage[0].doseAndRate.rate[x]","parentDataPath":"root.indicationGuideline.dosingGuideline.dosage.dosage[0].doseAndRate[0]","basePath":"root.dosage.rate[x]","baseId":"Dosage.doseAndRate.rate[x]","isPrimitive":false,"childPaths":["root.indicationGuideline.dosingGuideline.dosage.dosage[0].doseAndRate.rateRatio.numerator","root.indicationGuideline.dosingGuideline.dosage.dosage[0].doseAndRate.rateRatio.denominator","root.indicationGuideline.dosingGuideline.dosage.dosage[0].doseAndRate.rateRange.low","root.indicationGuideline.dosingGuideline.dosage.dosage[0].doseAndRate.rateRange.high","root.indicationGuideline.dosingGuideline.dosage.dosage[0].doseAndRate.rateQuantity.value","root.indicationGuideline.dosingGuideline.dosage.dosage[0].doseAndRate.rateQuantity.comparator","root.indicationGuideline.dosingGuideline.dosage.dosage[0].doseAndRate.rateQuantity.unit","root.indicationGuideline.dosingGuideline.dosage.dosage[0].doseAndRate.rateQuantity.system","root.indicationGuideline.dosingGuideline.dosage.dosage[0].doseAndRate.rateQuantity.code"],"multiTypeType":"Ratio","value":""},{"element":{"id":"Ratio.numerator","path":"Ratio.numerator","short":"Numerator value","definition":"The value of the numerator.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"Ratio.numerator","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"Quantity"}],"constraint":[{"key":"ele-1","severity":"error","human":"All FHIR elements must have a @value or children","expression":"hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())","xpath":"@value|f:*|h:div","source":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Element"}],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":".numerator"}]},"dataPath":"root.indicationGuideline.dosingGuideline.dosage.dosage[0].doseAndRate.rateRatio.numerator","parentDataPath":"root.indicationGuideline.dosingGuideline.dosage.dosage[0].doseAndRate.rate[x]","basePath":"root.dosage.rate[x].numerator","baseId":"Ratio.numerator","isPrimitive":false,"childPaths":["root.indicationGuideline.dosingGuideline.dosage.dosage[0].doseAndRate.rateRatio.numerator.value","root.indicationGuideline.dosingGuideline.dosage.dosage[0].doseAndRate.rateRatio.numerator.comparator","root.indicationGuideline.dosingGuideline.dosage.dosage[0].doseAndRate.rateRatio.numerator.unit","root.indicationGuideline.dosingGuideline.dosage.dosage[0].doseAndRate.rateRatio.numerator.system","root.indicationGuideline.dosingGuideline.dosage.dosage[0].doseAndRate.rateRatio.numerator.code"],"value":""},{"element":{"id":"Quantity.value","path":"Quantity.value","short":"Numerical value (with implicit precision)","definition":"The value of the measured amount.
